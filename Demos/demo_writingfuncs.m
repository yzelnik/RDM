%% Goals of demo: writing functions
%  This demo aim is to understand what are the main types of functions in RDM
%  and how to write and use each type of function

%% Local and Spatial functions for models
%  In general two main functions are used to define a model:
%  the local one, wihch controls the non-spatial dynamics and is typically non-linear
%  and the spatial one, which is often linear, such as S_RD for simple diffusion

%  The local function will generally return the right-hand-side of the non-spatial model
%  So that it returns a matrix of N 

%% Test functions

%% Modify-state functions
