# RDM
Reaction-Diffusion using Matlab

This library is meant to help running simulations and analysis on Reaction-Diffusion and similar PDE/spatial models.
Some basic information is given in the pdf manual: RdmManual.pdf
To get a better handle of the library, it is best to try and run the different demo files (in the demos subfolder), and look at some of the functions used in there.


To start using the library, first run the script setrdmpath.m from inside Matlab, which will setup the folders path.
